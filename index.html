                       We designed all-silicon, multi-featured band-selective perfect absorbing surfaces based on CMOS compatible processes. 
				The center wavelength of the band-selective absorber can be varied between 2 and 22 μm while a bandwidth as high as 2.5 μm is demonstrated.
				We used a silicon-on-insulator (SOI) wafer which consists of n-type silicon (Si) device layer, silicon dioxide (SiO2) as buried oxide layer, and n-type Si handle layer. 
				The center wavelength and bandwidth can be tuned by adjusting the conductivity of the Si device and handle layers as well as the thicknesses of the device and buried oxide layers. 
				We demonstrate proof-of-concept absorber surfaces experimentally. Such absorber surfaces are easy to microfabricate because the absorbers do not require elaborate microfabrication steps such as patterning. 
				Due to the structural simplicity, low-cost fabrication, wide spectrum range of operation, and band properties of the perfect absorber, the proposed multi-featured perfect absorber surfaces are promising for many applications. 
				These include sensing devices, surface enhanced infrared absorption applications, solar cells, meta-materials, frequency selective sensors and modulators.

                        Plasmonic perfect absorbers have found a wide range of applications in imaging, sensing, and
			light harvesting and emitting devices. Traditionally, metals are used to implement plasmonic
			structures. For sensing applications, it is desirable to integrate nanophotonic active surfaces with
			biasing and amplification circuitry to achieve monolithic low cost solutions. Commonly used
			plasmonic metals such as Au and Ag are not compatible with standard silicon complementary
			metal–oxide–semiconductor (CMOS) technology. Here we demonstrate plasmonic perfect
			absorbers based on high conductivity silicon. Standard optical lithography and reactive ion
			etching techniques were used for the patterning of the samples. We present computational and
			experimental results of surface plasmon resonances excited on a silicon surface at normal and
			oblique incidences. We experimentally demonstrate our absorbers as ultra-low cost, CMOScompatible 
			and efficient refractive index sensing surfaces.The experimental results reveal that the structure
			exhibits a sensitivity of around 11 000 nm/RIU and a figure of merit of up to 2.5.
			We also show that the sensing performance of the structure can be improved by increasing
			doping density.

			Absorbing infrared radiation efficiently is important for critical applications such as thermal imaging and infrared spectroscopy.
			Common infrared absorbing materials are not standard in Si VLSI technology. We demonstrate ultra-broadband mid-infrared absorbers based purely on silicon. 
			Broadband absorption is achieved by the combined effects of free carrier absorption, and vibrational and plasmonic absorption resonances. 
			The absorbers, consisting of periodically arranged silicon gratings, can be fabricated using standard optical lithography and deep reactive ion etching techniques, allowing for cost-effective and wafer-scale fabrication of micro-structures. 
			Absorption wavebands in excess of 15 micrometers (5–20 μm) are demonstrated with more than 90% average absorptivity.
			The structures also exhibit broadband absorption performance even at large angles of incidence (θ = 50°), and independent of polarization.

			Increasing light extraction efficiency and narrowing the angular spread of light emitted from optically thick light emitting diodes
				(LEDs) are desirable but difficult goals to achieve. In this paper, we design, optimize, and fabricate Vogel spiral arrays of dielectric
				nanostructures for optical directional extraction enhancement of incoherent emission from optically thick phosphor-converted LEDs. 
				In order to design and optimize large-scale structures, we perform a systematic numerical investigation based on full-vector three-dimensional
				finite difference time domain simulations using a cloud of randomly positioned and randomly phased dipoles that approximate an incoherent Lambertian source.
				An analytical model based on kinematic scattering is also developed and used to parametrically study changes in the emission profile as the spiral geometry is tuned. 
				The optimal Vogel spiral arrays are fabricated as TiO2 nanodisks atop YAG:Ce3+ blue-to-white converter layers using electron-beam lithography and reactive ion etching.
				Photoluminescence spectroscopy is used to experimentally measure extraction enhancement up to 2× compared to a flat reference. Finally, accurate Fourier-space (k-space)
				fluorescence spectroscopy is used to measure the emission intensity profile up to 54° in a single snapshot image, and we find up to a 35% enhancement in power-normalized
				forward emission compared to a flat reference, under remote laser excitation. The integration of optimized Vogel spiral arrays of dielectric nanoparticles with phosphor-converted
				LEDs will increase efficiency and narrow the directional spread of light. These effects are beneficial to a variety of active device applications, including imaging,
				lighting, and projecting devices that require enhanced extraction efficiency combined with directional emission.

			The ability to tailor the energy band lineup of semiconductor materials plays a key role in the development of many electronic
				and optoelectronic devices and normally relies on heteroepitaxy. Here, we report a different method, based on strain
				engineering, for the controlled introduction of variations in bandgap energy with lateral position in thin films.
				External stress is applied on Ge nanomembranes stacked with an array of amorphous-Si pillars in order to create a non-uniform strain
				(and therefore bandgap energy) distribution commensurate with the sample thickness variations.
				The resulting strain profiles are mapped using Bragg diffraction with a hard X-ray probe featuring nanoscale spatial resolution.
				Compared with traditional heterostructures grown by epitaxial techniques, these strain-engineered samples involve a single chemical 
				composition and are not limited in the choice of compatible materials by any restriction imposed by lattice-matching requirements. 
				Furthermore, their energy band lineups can be patterned in nearly arbitrary shapes using nanolithography to control the thickness 
				profile and can be tuned actively by varying the applied stress. As a result, these structures are attractive for a wide range
				of device applications (including lasers, LEDs, solar cells, and thermoelectrics) that require complex heterostructure lineups with multiple bandgap energies.
